# HackerRank

As the name would suggest (partially) this repo is about solution to HackerRank problems.

### Conventions:

* Folder Structure - More or less resembles problem classification in Hacker Rank (Domain > Topic > Level)
* File Name - Problem title (at the time of solution check-in)
* Problem Description: A short description followed by link to actual hacker rank problem.
